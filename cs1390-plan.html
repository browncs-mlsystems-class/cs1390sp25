<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>Many applications, across industries varying from ecommerce to
education, rely on data processing and machine learning systems for data
analytics tasks. Deep learning techniques are now being applied to
problems such as search, coding assistants, and chip placement. Due to
how widely used these applications are, performance, specifically
latency, throughput, and hardware efficiency, is very important.
However, achieving high performance in these systems can be
challenging.</p>
<p>This class will explore systems-related challenges related to
building, training, deploying and managing large-scale data processing
and machine learning systems. The learning goals of the class are for
students to deeply understand the systems techniques that allow ML
systems to be deployed efficiently, at scale. Topics include efficient
training and inference, understanding how to build hardware ML
algorithms, understanding ML algorithm performance, GPU programming and
cuda, recent transformer architectures, efficient retrieval, and
more.</p>
<p>This is the first offering of this class; students should anticipate
technical difficulties, and the course components and schedule are
subject to change.</p>
<h1 id="registration">Registration</h1>
<p>Due to constrained TA resources, this offering of CS 1390 will be
capped at 56 students. Students requesting an override must (a) have
fulfilled the prerequisites (CS 300, 330, or 1310, and one of (CS 410,
1410, 1470, 2470, 1420) and (b) complete course assignments during
shopping period. All registered students will be responsible for
completing all course assignments regardless of when they register for
the class. We will be managing the waitlist through the waitlist form
some of you may have filled out. The class is <em>already full</em>, so
unless registered students drop the class, we will not be letting
students off the waitlist. <em>If you are planning to drop the
class</em>, please do so ASAP so we can let students off the
waitlist.</p>
<h2 id="auditing">Auditing</h2>
<p>If you wish to audit the class, note that the aforementioned limits
on TA resources still apply, so we won’t be able to offer auditors
grading support or support in office hours.</p>
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid lightgrey; margin: 20px 0;">
<h1 id="coursestructure">Components and Grading</h1>
<h2 id="course-projects-65">Course Projects: 65 %</h2>
<p>The largest component of this class is a series of four course
projects. Each project will involve an implementation task and writeup
that answers conceptual questions. Course staff will grade projects
based on the correctness and performance of the implementation, and
clarity of the writeup. Projects may either be graded offline by course
staff, or through live meetings with course staff. During these gradings
meetings, students should be able to answer technical questions about
the project. Projects in this course offering are in both Python (using
Pytorch) and Cuda (to program GPUs). The breakdown of how much each
project contributes to the final grade is below (percentages add to
65).</p>
<ul>
<li>Project 0: 18 %</li>
<li>Project 1: 18 %</li>
<li>Project 2: 18 %</li>
<li>Project 3: 11 %</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="written-homeworks-20">Written Homeworks: 20 %</h2>
<p>There will be two written homeworks, where students read pieces of
technical writing (either a research paper or a tech report), and
students must respond to conceptual questions. Responses will be graded
on clarity. Late hours cannot be used on the written homeworks.</p>
<h2 id="post-lecture-quizzes-10">Post Lecture Quizzes: 10 %</h2>
<p>After almost all the lectures, the teaching staff will post a short
quiz that reinforces lecture content, which will be graded on
completeness and correctness. If you have attended the lecture (or
watched the lecture video posted to canvas), you should be able to
answer the quiz questions. Students <em>cannot submit PLQ responses
late</em>, but they can <em>miss up to 5 PLQs across the entire
semester</em>, no questions asked. If there is a PLQ, it will be posted
right after each lecture and the response is due at the start of the
<em>next</em> lecture (responses will not be accepted after this).</p>
<h2 id="class-participation-5">Class Participation: 5 %</h2>
<p>The final component of the grade is class participation. Students can
participate in a number of ways: answering each other’s questions on
EdStem, asking particularly helpful questions in EdStem, lecture, or
office hours, and helping each other in office hours.</p>
<h2 id="late-policy-for-course-projects">Late Policy (for Course
Projects)</h2>
<p>Each student has 144 total late hours for projects. These hours are
designed to help you cope with unexpected emergencies, and only apply to
project submissions. In other words, you can hand in your projects late,
but the total amount of lateness summed over all the deadlines must not
exceed 144 hours. For the purpose of calculating late hours, we exclude
hours between midnight and 7am. This means that you can get a good
night’s sleep before you continue working on your project without losing
extra late hours while you sleep.</p>
<p>If you don’t hand in a project by the last day of classes, we’ll give
the assignment a zero (i.e., no credit whatsoever). However, if you hand
an assignment in late, and your total late time (including the late time
for that assignment) exceeds 144 hours, and you hand it in by the last
day of classes, then we’ll give it a D or an F depending on whether it
seems to basically work. Therefore, it’s better to complete and hand in
a project even if you have already used your late hours.</p>
<p>You can divide up your 144 hours among the projects however you like;
you don’t have to ask or tell us, but you <em>cannot use more than 72
hours per project</em>. Finally, can only use the 144 hours for the
projects, and not for post-lecture quizzes or for the written homework.
If you want an exception to these rules, you will need a Dean’s
note.</p>
<p>Finally, if you find yourself struggling, please contact the
instructors as soon as you feel able; and if you have a health condition
that affects your learning or classroom experience, please contact us so
we can seek accommodations. We do not generally make exceptions to the
late policy, but we work hard to help all our students complete the
course without overwhelming stress.</p>
<h2 id="time-breakdown">Time Breakdown</h2>
<p>Students should expect to spend 3 hours per week in lecture, and
approximately 10 hours a week working on the course projects and/or
written homeworks, for a total of 180 hours over the entire week.</p>
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid lightgrey; margin: 20px 0;">
<h1 id="collaboration">Collaboration Policy</h1>
<p>Students should understand and follow the <a
href="https://college.brown.edu/design-your-education/academic-policies/academic-code">Brown
Academic Code</a> and the <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/offices/student-conduct/code">Code of
Student Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, specific to this course, we <em>encourage working with
other students to build conceptual understanding and debug software
issues</em>. However, each student is responsible for their own project
implementation and writeup, and their own written homework response.</p>
<p>Students must understand their submissions; instructors will
interview and quiz students about their answers as part of the grading
process to determine this. For all class assignments, students must cite
all sources (people, websites, papers, etc.) that they consult as a part
of their work. External sources include but are not limited to
previously published articles, blog posts, Stackoverflow or similar
sites, conversations with other people, etc. This policy is not meant to
discourage the use of external sources, but rather to codify a standard
academic practice. Be generous with citations.</p>
<p>A note about generative AI: students should not use generative AI to
fill in code snippets for any of the course projects, or write answers
to the conceptual questions or written assignments. Remember that
instructors always reserve the right to ask students about their
implementations and writeups, so it is important for students to have
worked through the assignments.</p>
<p>Finally, by taking this class, you agree to never post solutions for
any assignments publicly.</p>
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid lightgrey; margin: 20px 0;">
<h1 id="schedule">Schedule</h1>
<h2 id="homeworks-and-projects">Homeworks and Projects</h2>
<p>Note that all dates are tentative and we may change the schedule as
the course goes on. Homeworks and projects will be released latest by 5
PM on the release date, and will be due at <em>6 PM on the due
date</em>.</p>
